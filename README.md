# basic-calculator

This is a simple project I am working on to familiarize myself with the C++ QT framework. It will eventually contain a minimal, standalone calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

To build/run this project, you can open basic-calculator.pro using Qt Creator and build/run it from there. Alternatively, you can build it using the command line on OS X by running

```
qmake
make
```

This will create a basic-calculator.app file which can be opened as a standalone application.
